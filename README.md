Don't use this for anything besides learning. Really, don't. Go use Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. This is just an application that holds a list of students made in Python using PySimpleGUI and SQLite3. The only functionality is **C.R.U.D.** operations with a **Search Bar**. ;)

## Run it yourself

To execute, copy then run the 'sg.py' file. _(Make sure you have PySimpleGUI installed)_

```console
pip install PySimpleGUI
python3 ./sg.py
```
